=====================
Welcome to my blog! My main website for rfelixallen.com lives in a separate repo to better manage with AWS Amplify. This site is my blog, where I can talk about projects I am working on.

The theme of this blog is called Minimal. I wanted to focus on the blog content, and not the styling. The base repo can be found here: https://github.com/pages-themes/minimal


Build Notes
